# Remote

Roblox Library for Managing Remote Events, Functions, and States

Remote provides a simple, centralized API for creating and accessing remote
events, functions, and states (i.e. replicated data) for a Roblox project

## Prior Art

Remote's API serves a similar function to existing Roblox libraries for
centralizing remote communication such as
[Comm](https://sleitnick.github.io/RbxUtil/api/Comm/) and
[Postie](https://github.com/sheepish12/Postie), as well as wrapping and
simplifying Roblox's
[Built-In remote API](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/RemoteEvent)
